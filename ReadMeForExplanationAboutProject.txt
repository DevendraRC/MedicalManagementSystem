MEDICAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
is a simple Spring Boot application for managing information about medicines:

Components:


Controller (MedController):
Handles HTTP requests and defines endpoints for various operations.
Endpoints include getting a list of medicines, getting details of a specific medicine,
 adding a new medicine, updating a medicine, and deleting a medicine.
 
 
Data Access Object (MedDao):
Extends JpaRepository to provide standard CRUD operations for the Medicine entity.
Manages the interaction with the underlying database using Spring Data JPA.


Entity (Medicine):
Represents the model for medicines with fields such as id, name, and description.
Annotated with JPA annotations for database mapping.


Service Interface (MedService):
Declares methods for managing medicines, including getting a list, retrieving details, 
adding, updating, and deleting.


Service Implementation (MedServiceimpl):
Implements the business logic for the methods declared in MedService.
Uses MedDao for database interaction.


Operations:

GET /home:
Returns a welcome message for the Medical Management System.

GET /medicines:
Retrieves a list of all medicines.


GET /medicines/{medicineId}:
Retrieves details of a specific medicine based on its ID.


POST /medicines:
Adds a new medicine to the system.


PUT /medicines/{medicineId}:
Updates an existing medicine based on its ID.


DELETE /medicines/{medicineId}:
Deletes a medicine based on its ID. Handles cases where the medicine is not found.


Data Storage:
Medicines are stored in a database, and interactions with the database are handled using Spring Data JPA.


Exception Handling:
Uses exception handling to manage scenarios such as medicine not found (EmptyResultDataAccessException) during deletion.


Additional Notes:
The system is designed to be a basic CRUD application for managing medicines.
It utilizes common Spring technologies for building RESTful web services and interacting with databases.
This system can be extended and enhanced based on specific requirements such as adding more fields to the Medicine entity, 
implementing additional business logic, or securing endpoints.
